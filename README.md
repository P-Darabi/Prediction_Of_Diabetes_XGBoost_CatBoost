# Prediction_Of_Diabetes_XGBoost_CatBoost
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide and can lead to serious health complications if left untreated. Early diagnosis and prediction of diabetes can help patients receive timely treatment and prevent the onset of complications. On the other hand, XGBoost and CatBoost are powerful machine-learning models that can be used to predict diabetes based on patient data. By providing accurate predictions, these models can help healthcare professionals make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes. Once the model is trained and validated, it can be used to predict the diabetes status of new patients based on their medical data. This can be a valuable tool for healthcare professionals to identify patients who are at risk of developing diabetes and provide them with timely interventions to prevent or manage the disease
